    <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>

    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry<br>
         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
         It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
         typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release<br>
         of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
         software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> 
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br>
        making it over 2000 years old. </p>

        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br>
         as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. </p>
